# MAGIC ## Variables & Scope
# MAGIC Below we're doing a few things:
# MAGIC 1. First, we're relying on the dlt workflow config to store our variables that might differ between orgs.
# MAGIC 2. Second, we're storing a handful of our variables in the databricks Secrets store. This is valuable because it's a safe, encrypted store of variables that never need to be exposed.
# MAGIC 3. Finally, we're hard-coding our schema. This is *okay* as long as it doesn't change, but ideally we'd want to evaluate this against the unknown structure of the payload. If the structure changes, we risk losing data by hard-coding it this way however for a POC this will serve our needs just fine.

# DBTITLE 1,Stream Source to Bronze
# This setting makes PARTION BY writes faster, but could make reads slower.
# We generally only recommend doing this when most of the data falls into the same partition
# like in this case because we're partitioning everything into today's date.

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Parsing the Stream Events
# MAGIC Parsing the stream events is a fairly straightforward process of decoding the binary column with the schema defined above. We want to preserve the messageId field and timestamp the event as it's being processed to keep track of what's going on and which records are related. The messageId is how we'll stictch together the timeline later on.
# MAGIC * The messageId is the unique identifier for the event
# MAGIC * The payload is the encoded stream values
# MAGIC * The publishTimestampInMillis is when the original generator of the event triggered
# MAGIC * eventTime is when the table receives the event

# COMMAND ----------

# DBTITLE 1,Decode Bronze to Struct

  return read_stream

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Temporary Views in DLT
# MAGIC DLT supports the concept of both temporary tables and temporary views. This is handy in our circumstance because we will only be joining on a subset of the data. **Technically** we can accomplish the same thing **if** we know the partition structure of the DNTL table - if this where the case and we know for example that the partition column is set up on bus_object_typ_cd then we can get away without the view and instead rely on the predicate clause instead. Using a view however does make things a bit more readable so it may be preferable if this logic is passed around for future growth.

# COMMAND ----------

# DBTITLE 1,Create the DNTL View
@dlt.view(
    name="dntl_vw",
    comment="This view only contains a subset of the dntl data that we require for a left-static join",

    )

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC ## Static-stream Joins
# MAGIC Databricks supports joining static tables to streaming data, but requires that the static tables be on the left of the join. This is handy when we need to enrich our data with lookup tables.

# MAGIC ## Window Functions
# MAGIC Window functions are a useful tool that we can use to 'bucket' events into aggregations. For this example, we will be doing some average values for certain time groups based on the timestamp values

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Watermarks
# MAGIC Watermarks are very similar to sliding windows, but can be updated dynamically with late events. This is a handy way to deal with streams that may submit events in a non-ordinal fashion, or if you want to order / bucket by a different feature. This also takes into account terminated streams that require back-fill when resumed. More info and a complete & comprehensive explanation of how all things structured streaming can be found [here](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/structured-streaming-programming-guide.html#handling-late-data-and-watermarking)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## A Quick Note on Gold Tables
# MAGIC Sometimes it benefits us to have a materliazed table or view as a 'gold' table. Gold tables don't necessarily need to be aggregate-level and can contain a small subset of data. In our case, we'll want to isolate a handful of events for our gold streaming to our data sink. This will be useful for late-stage queries that don't rely on pushdown predicates.
