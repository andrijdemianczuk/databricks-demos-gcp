# MAGIC ## Introduction
# MAGIC In this series, we will be connecting to a GCS bucket and loading some XML data in systematically for some basic ETL. This is a common use-case and although XML isn't as widely used as other storage formats it is still considered powerful with it's recursion and nesting capabilities.

# MAGIC ## Part 3: Enriching the data
# MAGIC In this notebook we will be creating some enrichments to our data by aggregating and truncating some of the data points for ease-of-access and readability. These will be considered our 'gold' tables and can be used for BI/BA
